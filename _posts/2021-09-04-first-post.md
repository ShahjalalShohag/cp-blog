Welcome to my blog! I go by [smax](https://codeforces.com/profile/smax) on Codeforces and most other competitive programming sites, and this is a fun personal project for me that I've always wanted to do. On this blog, I'll post articles about techniques, tricks, opinions, or pretty much anything remotely related to CP. Do check it out if you're interested.

For starters, here's a link to my first tutorial article on [Burnside's Lemma]({{ site.baseurl }}/burnside/). I typed this up a few months prior to making this website as personal notes for myself, so it's possible that the article may be unclear in certain sections. If you have any tips on making certain sections clearer, feel free to comment below.

If you're instead interested in something more opinionated, you can check out [this article]({{ site.baseurl }}/practice/) on how to practice and get good at CP. If you find you like the stuff I post, feel free to sign up for the mailing list by scrolling down and clicking on the alert, so that you get instantly notified whenever I post.

Finally, this site was created with Jekyll and uses the ["Mediumish"](https://github.com/wowthemesnet/mediumish-theme-jekyll) theme, so if you like how the site looks be sure to check that out.
